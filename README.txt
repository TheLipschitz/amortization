This program takes several user inputs to determine a full amortization schedule for a mortgage.
You can use this tool to help get an idea of how adding principal payments each month or increasing your down 
payment can affect the loan in the long term. 

The user can enter their own numbers for each prompt (if you aren't sure of a number on a specific question like PMI or 
Escrow, you can guess or just enter 0, as these will not affect the loan itself), or can modify the provided example settings file 
to load them all at once. 

Please note that the person who wrote this code is not a financial adviser and is in no way affiliated with any financial
institution. This is simply a tool for personal use to acheive a more detailed idea of a mortgage while shopping for a new home.
